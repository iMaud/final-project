            <h2>BONOBO</h2>
            <p><strong>Simon Green</strong> (born 30 March 1976), known by his stage name <strong>Bonobo</strong>, is a british musician, producer and DJ based in Los Angeles. He initially debuted with a trip-hop aesthetic, and has since explored more upbeat approaches while experimenting with jazz and world music. His electronic sounds incorporates the use of organic instrumentation, and is recreated by a full band during his live performances.</p>

            <p>Bonobo’s sound is oriented on beats and samples but typically “soothing”, combining influences ranging from club music to world music. <em>Ptichfork</em> named him a key figure in the 2000s downtempo electronica scene while <em>The Guardian</em> associated him with the recent popularity of “ambient world electronica”. While his earliest work was firmly based in trip hop, his style soon became more upbeat and delved into genres such as jazz (which has led him to be described as a nu jazz artist) and traditional Indian music. He has collaborated with various artists, including Bajka, Andreya Triana, Erykah Badu, and Rhye who contributed vocals to songs on his last four albums <strong>Days to Come</strong>, <strong>Black Sands</strong>, <strong>The North Borders</strong>, and <strong>Migration</strong>, respectively.</p>
            <p>Whilst often touring solo, and performing DJ sets and residencies, in 2010 Bonobo opted to start touring with a full band for the Black Sands tour. The band plays live renditions of studio material, with a singer, keyboardist, guitarist, saxophonist, string section, electronics, and drummer, often with improvisations and solos. His albums employ sampling, for example ‘Behind the Light’ (from Pick Up EP, 2003) uses a clip of ‘Judy’ from John Renbourn.</p>
